# Heart Disease Prediction

This project is my TP exam in machine learning and aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using a dataset and various machine learning models. It involves preprocessing the data, training different classifiers, evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and visualizing the results.

## Project Overview

### Features:

- Implements the following machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest

- Evaluates models using metrics from `sklearn.metrics`.

- Visualizes results with confusion matrices and an accuracy comparison histogram.

### Dataset:

The dataset used is `heart.csv`, which contains features related to heart disease prediction. Ensure the dataset is in the repository or provide the correct path to it.
